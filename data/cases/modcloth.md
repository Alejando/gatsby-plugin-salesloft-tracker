Modcloth is an online retailer with a revenue of more than $100 million.

We worked in the Modcloth project, a Indie Clothing, Retro Clothing & Vintage Outfits store.

Developed in Ruby on Rails 2.3.2 using state_machine.

Product Browsing with different attributes (shoes or dresses have specific attributes). Checkout with gift certificates and coupon discounts. Trust Commerce and Paypal Payment gateways. Trained new team members and led the team.

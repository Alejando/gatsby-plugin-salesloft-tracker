SaaS based virtual assistant application for busy working professionals with families to handle everything from planning doctor visits to a spin class. The application gives families the ability to have and share a family calendar for planning everyoneâ€™s active lives.

**Client loves Density Labs because:**

* Strong agile methodology.
* Quality of product output.
* The tech leads were able to translate design into technical requirements without lots of hand holding.

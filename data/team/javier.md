I'm an enthusiastic software developer. I found my passion when I wrote my first lines of HTML ten years ago. I have worked with Ruby and JavaScript technologies, also mentored React.js and competed in Hackathons and IT Olympics. Lately, I've been interested in functional programming. I like to do calisthenics in my free time.

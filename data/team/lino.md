Well-thought design, attention to detail, and great user experience are things I’m very passionate about. I’m always looking to learn new things and catch up on the latest tools, especially Open Source ones. I always give my all so that every project shines.
 
My hobbies are video games (mainly Nintendo & PC), following new technology and scientifical advances, absorbing videos at 2x, apologetics, and playing around with Blender 3D.

I'm a Software Engineer with more than 4 years of experience in software development, mainly in the web area. I have knowledge of technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Laravel, ReacJS, VueJS, GIT, 2 years of experience dealing with clients. I'm constantly looking to improve my technical skills doing research, and reading about new technologies.

I love to travel and get to know new cultures, visit our different offices and workmates, and I like to challenge myself to giving the best of me.

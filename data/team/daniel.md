I have been working professionally with software since 2012. Itâ€™s been an exciting journey and I have been involved in all kind of projects, from designing data models up to building rich and dynamic user interfaces. My current language of choice is JavaScript; however, I have a growing interest for many other programming languages including Haskell, Clojure and Elixir.

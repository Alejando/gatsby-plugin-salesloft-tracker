I’m a QA engineer with 6 years of experience, 3 of them working with international clients. I’m passionate about quality processes in all kind of projects, not only those related to software development.
 
I help teams develop and execute functional tests for both web and mobile applications. My main goals are to continue learning new techniques and to share this knowledge with my coworkers in order to develop high-quality products.

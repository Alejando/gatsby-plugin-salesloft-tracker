You may refer multiple people for job positions but you cannot refer yourself.

#### Different Ways of Referring:
- Send an email to refer@densitylabs.io with your friend's personal information: full name, email and mobile phone.
- Send an email to your friend and "CC" refer@densitylabs.io.
- Go to careers section on our website and refer your friend.

Your referral must fully comply with Density Labs' requirements and successfully pass our recruitment process.
If your referral gets a job within our team and remains in the company for 3 consecutive months, then the referral will be payed. Prior to payment you will receive an email notification to provide us with a bank account number for the money transfer.

#### Referral Rules
- If there are multiple referrals for the same person, we will consider the e-mail/web-form timestamp.
- If your referral is eligible and the position remains open, he/she will be contacted within the following 3-5 work days by our recruiter. In case the position has been filled, the recruiter will contact your friend within the following 6-15 work days with new roles opening up in the future.
